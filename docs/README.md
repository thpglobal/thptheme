# Wordpress Theme to Match thp.org

As of 2020, thp.org global website is based on divi, which costs money and is sludgy to use. To facilitate others creating "matching" website, I've created a standard Wordpress 5 theme called thptheme and publicly available under github.com/thpglobal/thptheme

I'm also in the process of creating a new "block-based" theme consistent with the Wordpress 6 best practices that will be available (soon) as github.com/thpglobal/thp2022
