# thptheme

### Theme for THP websites starting in 2021

This is based on untheme, and further stripped down to get rid of comments and sidebar.
Additions include: 
* drop down menus css3
* responsive hamburger menu
* action bar in footer
* 4 footer responsive widget areas
* change the sidebar in posts to be in a 30% column using standard wordpress classes
* 1 footer full-page-width header below that for validations
* countup class - cf https://jshakespeare.com/simple-count-up-number-animation-javascript-react/
* sticky header
* make sure style.css is not cached in enqueue function
* integrate all css in the default style.css

Removals include:
* don't show title (anyway to make this a customization option?)

## Installation

* download the zip file
* upload it as the theme
* when updating, just upload again and it will ask whether you mean to replace the old one (yes, you do!)

## Settings
