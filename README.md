# thptheme

### Theme for THP websites starting in 2021

This is based on untheme, and further stripped down to get rid of comments and sidebar.
Additions include: 
* drop down menus css3
* 3 footer responsive widget areas
* sticky header

Removals include:
* don't show title (anyway to make this a customization option?)
